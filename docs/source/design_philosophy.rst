1.  Use cases, goals and preferences of users should be clearly known.
2.  UI should be self-explanatory. There shouldn't be any need of extensive
    documentation for users
3.  UI should be task centric, not feature centric
4.  The user interface is said to be well designed only when the program model
    conforms to the user model
5.  UI design should be consistent. UI designers shouldn't use their creativity
    to make an UI which works in totally different way than other programs
    intended for same purpose.
