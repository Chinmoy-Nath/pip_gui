Welcome Page
============

.. image:: UserWorkFlow.png

The welcome page serves as a staring point for the user to interact with the
GUI. In order to help user to easily decide between different choices, all user
tasks are divided in two parts :

1.  Install New Packages
2.  Manage Installed Packages

These user tasks are separated and placed in two different pages to eliminate
confusion ( which could be due to presenting more than 5 choices to the user)
between different available choices.
