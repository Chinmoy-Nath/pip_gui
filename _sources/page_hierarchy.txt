Page Layout Hierarchy
=====================

The following figure depicts the hierarchy of page layouts based on user
work flow. Each level requires a decison to be made by the user. Therefore,
lesser the number of levels, better is the UI design provided that user
shouldn't be presented with too many choices at once (in order to reduce the
number of levels).
